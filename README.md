Nucleus ESP is cheap yellow hack toy.
It can ring some SubGhz RF bells, and maybe more, i just need to test it.
I desoldered RGB diod, to make it use as GPIO, and i use LCD Backlight pin as CC1101 CS...
It is my first project in c, which i started at the start of the summer, with some experience with PHP, and little of FPGA tindering.
I learn as i go, just by doing things.
Its WIP so please dont be hars to it.
I got SDR, so i managed to implement RAW protocol for replay by simle bitBang.
Now i can put back RCswitch and .sub (flipper) file player, which are on old GUI, and are not implemented in to the new one.
Happy Hacking!
