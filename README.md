Nucleus ESP is cheap yellow hack toy.
It can ring some SubGhz RF bells, and maybe more, but i dont have SDR yet, so i dont really know.
I desoldered RGB diod, to make it use as GPIO, and i use LCD Backlight pin as CC1101 CS...
It is my first project in c, which i started at the start of the summer, with some experience with PHP, and little of FPGA tindering.
I learn as i go, just by doing things.
Its WIP so please dont be hars to it.
Happy Hacking!
