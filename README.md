Nucleus ESP is cheap yellow hack toy.
It can ring some SubGhz RF bells, and maybe more, but i dont have SDR yet, so i dont reallz know.
It is my first project in c, which i started at the start of the summer, with some experience with PHP, and little of FPGA tindering. Its WIP so please dont be hars to it.
Happy Hacking!
